# Motion Capture Display
An interactive motion capture art installation for DG8002 Digital Media Environments  
by Michael Young, Mingao Sun, Kwaku Poku-Dankwa

## Goals
1. Build an interactive motion capture art installation
	- Use motion to drive animation
	- Use motion to control sound / create a simple synthesizer
2. Use a digital projector and webcam to capture motion and project the artwork
3. Integrate other interactive objects within the scene (stretch goal).

## Audience:
Our project is geared towards visitors of multimedia exhibitions, interactive art installations and public spaces. It caters to individuals of all ages and backgrounds who enjoy interactive and immersive technology-driven experiences.

## Technology Stack:
1. [P5js](https://p5js.org) for graphics and sound
2. [Google Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) for gesture detection
3. [ml5 PoseNet](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet) for simplified gesture detection
4. Native web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
5. Third-party libraries Audio processing libraries for triggering sound effects based on user actions.

## Examples of use cases:
- Multimedia exhibitions: Visitors to art exhibitions can interact with digital artworks through facial expressions and gestures, and trigger visual and audio effects based on their movements.
- Interactive Public Spaces: In public spaces such as shopping malls or parks, passersby can interact with interactive displays projected onto walls or screens to create interesting and dynamic interactions.
- Educational installations: Schools or museums can utilize interactive installations for educational activities.
